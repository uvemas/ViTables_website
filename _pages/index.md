# Overview

*ViTables* is a component of the [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/) family. It is a GUI for browsing and editing 
files in both PyTables and [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) formats. It is developed using 
[Python](http://www.python.org/) and [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro) (the Python
bindings to [Qt](http://www.qt.io/), so it can run on any platform that supports these components.

*ViTables* capabilities include easy navigation through the data hierarchy, displaying of real data and
its associated metadata, a simple, yet powerful, browsing of multidimensional data and much more.

As a viewer, one of the greatest strengths of *ViTables* is its ability to display very large datasets.
Tables with *one thousand millions of rows* (and beyond) are navigated stunningly fast and with very low
memory requirements. So, if you ever need to browse huge tables, don't hesitate, *ViTables* is your choice.

If you need a customized browser for managing your HDF5 data, *ViTables* is an excellent
starting point.
