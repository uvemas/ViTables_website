# How to get it

Stable versions
---------------
The stable versions of *ViTables* (source and wheel packages) are available in its
[SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vitables/files/ViTables-3.0.0/).

The latest version is also available as a [conda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vitables) that can be installed with conda.

Sources repository
------------------
In addition, you can get the latest (and possibly buggiest ;-) sources from the git repository if you follow 
[these instructions](http://vitables.org/Docs/faq.html#how-can-i-use-the-latest-revision-from-the-git-repository).

GNU/Linux packages
------------------
*ViTables* packages exist for several GNU/Linux distributions, although they
aren't always up to date. Some of these distros are OpenSUSE, Mandriva,
Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Trisquel and Fink. Just use the distro's
package manager in order to find and install *ViTables*.

Other sources
-------------
Last but not least, *ViTables* is included in a couple of scientific-oriented
Python distributions, [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) and
[Python(x,y)](http://python-xy.github.io/).
Also you can get the Windows binaries (and many other binaries for interesting
software) from Christoph Gohlke's [website](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#vitables).
