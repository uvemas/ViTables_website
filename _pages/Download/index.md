# How to get it

Stable versions
---------------
The current stable version of *ViTables* is available in its [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/ViTables/) and as a [conda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vitables).

Sources repository
------------------
In addition, you can get the latest (and possibly buggiest ;-) sources from the git repository if you follow
[these instructions](../Docs/faq/index.html#how-can-i-use-the-latest-revision-from-the-git-repository).

GNU/Linux packages
------------------
*ViTables* packages exist for several GNU/Linux distributions, although they
aren't always up to date. Some of these distros are OpenSUSE, Mandriva,
Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Trisquel and Fink. Just use the distro's
package manager in order to find and install *ViTables*.
