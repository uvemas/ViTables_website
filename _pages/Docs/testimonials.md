      <p>ViTables has proved itself as an excellent solution for my research
      using high-density electrical neuroimaging. The efficiency with which
      it lets me graphically access HDF5 datasets, even extremely large ones,
      is simply unparalleled. Highly recommended!

      <p>Recently, I discovered the PyTables library which offers a convenient
      way to store my numerical data -- mostly present in form of time series
      -- in a HDF5 file. Through this storage format, I can preserve the properties
      of the time series (associated dates and masks) while storing the data on
      disk for later processing. ViTables offers an excellent way to inspect such
      data sets visually and moreover to query and explore the data sets. The
      developer is very responsive to questions and feature requests that improve
      user experience. I can recommend it to anyone working with scientifc data sets.
